Hi! My name is Fiona Abraham and I am a computer information systems major and statistics minor here at [Appalachian State University](https://www.appstate.edu/). In my free time, I enjoy watching documentaries, eating spicy food, travelling, and discovering new music. My academic interests include big data analytics, artificial intelligence, and human rights.

Born and raised in Toronto until I was twelve, my family and I moved to North Carolina after my father got a job offer in Durham, North Carolina. Since then, I have lived in five different cities and have travelled to four out of the seven continents. Travelling is one of my biggest passions and I believe everyone should travel as frequently as possible. 

Below are some of my favorite pictues.
